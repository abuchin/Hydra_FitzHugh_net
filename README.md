This classical model could be presented as a simplification of the Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. 
It describes the periodic voltage oscillations of the neuron membrane. This model is often used to model the cardiomyocytes of a heart,
where the spatial expantion of the model could have the travelling and spiral wave solutions. For modelling of a hydra it is interesting 
with respect to the wide spikes. It is possible that this model could serve the mathematical foundation to describe the slow calcium 
spikes in hydra.
